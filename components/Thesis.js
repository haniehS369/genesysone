        <h2>Investment Thesis</h2>
        <h3> We look for opportunities that have:</h3>
        <p>
        <b>Scale of the vision.</b> Does the price have the potential to grow exponentially? Will its demand, transaction volume, and usage in the mainstream increase consistently over-time?
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Strong teams.</b> Are the founders mission-driven? Do they have exceptional product vision, technical abilities, proven track records, ethics, and the ability to execute? Are the teams united, calculated, high-performing, and willing to walk through walls to succeed?
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Fundamental technology.</b> Based on new and innovative cryptoeconomic mechanisms, whether it be new data structures or new economic incentives.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Unfair advantages.</b> Do they have proprietary technologies, information advantages, exceptional teams and advisors, first-mover advantages, or exclusive partnerships?
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Active community.</b> Do they have a strong community of evangelists, customers or developers?
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Simplicity in their mission, technology, and message.</b> Is it clear and compelling to followers?
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>New market potential.</b> Are they creating a new category or new marketplace, at the right time?
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>The next wave.</b> Weâ€™re looking for stealth and early-stage projects that will be at the forefront of upcoming trends in the cryptoasset space.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Tokens.</b> Is it crucial to how the protocol works? Tokens should be linked to incentives, rather than just a bolt-on business model or means to raise funds.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Endurance.</b> Will it be able to grow over-time in a sustainable way? Will the platform create network effects that enable defensibility and sustainable economic moats as it grows?
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Ambitious roadmaps</b> that are achievable. Does their roadmap convey a clear path to growth? Do we believe they can consistently overdeliver?
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Early-stage.</b> We take a contrarian-view on cryptoasset investment opportunities and look for undervalued investments that the mainstream are not aware of, or are not interested in, yet.
